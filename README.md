# pyoracle

A pure-Python driver for a proprietary database, implementing the
[DB-API 2.0](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/) interface by speaking the
database's native wire protocol (TNS/TTC) directly over TCP.

No proprietary client libraries or SDKs are required.

## Status

This project is in early development. The wire protocol is being
reverse-engineered and implemented incrementally.

What works so far:

- TNS transport layer (packet framing, fragmentation, SDU negotiation)
- TTC presentation layer (token encoding/decoding)
- Authentication handshake (O3LOGON, O5LOGON with 128/192/256-bit keys)
- Session setup and teardown
- SQL statement execution, full result-set decoding (DCB / RXH / RXD / BVC)
- DB-API 2.0 surface: `oracle.connect()`, `Connection.cursor()`,
  `Cursor.execute / fetchone / fetchmany / fetchall / description /
  rowcount`, iteration protocol, context managers, PEP 249 exception
  hierarchy
- Bind variables: `cur.execute(sql, [v1, v2])` (positional) or
  `cur.execute(sql, {"name": v})` (named, `:name` placeholders, case-
  insensitive); accepted bind types are `int`, `float`, `Decimal`,
  `str`, `bytes`, `bool`, `datetime.date` / `datetime` (with optional
  timezone and microseconds), and `None`
- Python type coercion for fetched values: NUMBER → `int` / `Decimal`,
  VARCHAR2 / CHAR → `str` (charset-aware), DATE / TIMESTAMP / TIMESTAMP
  WITH TIME ZONE → `datetime.datetime`, NULL → `None`
- Transaction control (commit, rollback, ping)
- Multiple character set support

What is still in progress:

- Cursor caching
- LOB support
- SSL/TLS connections
- Connection pooling
- Comprehensive error handling (Oracle error message text is not yet
  extracted from OER — currently surfaced as `"ORA-NNNNN"` codes only)

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- [pycryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)

## Installation

```
pip install .
```

## Quick start

```python
import oracle

with oracle.connect(host="dbhost", port=1521, user="scott",
                    password="tiger", service_name="MYDB") as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute(
            "SELECT id, name FROM employees WHERE dept = :dept ORDER BY id",
            {"dept": "ENG"},
        )
        for row in cur:
            print(row)
```

## Running tests

The default test suite is offline (encoders, crypto, packet round-trips):

```
python3 -m unittest discover -v tests/
```

A second suite of **integration tests** exercises type coercion and the
Cursor API against a real database. They are skipped unless connection
parameters are exported in the environment:

```
export PYORACLE_TEST_USER=pyo
export PYORACLE_TEST_PASSWORD=pyo123
export PYORACLE_TEST_HOST=localhost          # optional, default localhost
export PYORACLE_TEST_PORT=1521               # optional, default 1521
export PYORACLE_TEST_SERVICE=XE              # optional, default XE
python3 -m unittest discover -v tests/
```

The user only needs `CREATE SESSION` and `CREATE TABLE` privileges plus
a writable tablespace. Each test creates and drops its own scratch
table.

> **Known flake.** A small number of integration tests occasionally fail
> with `ORA-01013` ("user requested cancel of current operation") under
> rapid connect/disconnect churn — a residual protocol-state issue in the
> driver that surfaces when the same socket is hammered with statements
> in quick succession. A single re-run typically clears it.
